# Scintilla

A simple 2D Game framework for HTML5.

Alpha test: [play here](http://tobiasbu.github.io/website/portfolio/untitled-space/)

I'm a OO programmer and now I'm learning Javascript.
A lot of stuff of this repository was written learning and reading in others frameworks like Phaser, melonJS, PIXI and others.
For a while the code is mess.

It is in Development!
