2D Game framework for HTML5 ~ good as a good dog. 

Alpha test: [play here](http://kaltkaffee.github.io/dist/index.html)

I'm a OO programmer and now I'm learning Javascript. 
A lot of stuff of this repository was written learning and reading in others frameworks like Phaser, melonJS, PIXI and others.
For a while the code is mess.

It is in Development!
